# Hi there 👋

- 👋 I’m @SpyrossS3, but I go by Spyro, and my actual name is Camille R. 🎊 And I’m interested in Computer Programming, specifically working with Python and Data Science,
as well as developing any random idea that pops in my head as good practice and experimentation!
- Female | She/Her
- 📔 I’m currently studying for my BS in Computer Science, on my sixth year now, even though credit-wise I'm still a Junior since switching majors from Computer Eng.
- 👓 My skillset includes: Python, SQL, Markdown, HTML, CSS, C++, MATLAB, JavaScript, C, Java, Unix, Perl (By order of skill from best to worst)
- 📫 You can reach me at my email posted in my profile, other links on my Carrd.co also found on my profile page, or start a thread in my Discussions for this repo.
